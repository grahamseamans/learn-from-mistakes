# Technical Summary: Learning from Mistakes

## Core Idea
Memory-based continual learning where model only trains on mistakes:
- Inference-only on current task
- Store mistakes in memory buffer (random replacement when full)
- Batch mistakes until threshold (5 mistakes) before training
- Train on memory until high accuracy (97%)
- No explicit regularization or complex mechanisms

## Implementation Details
- Network: Simple CNN (2 conv layers, 3 FC layers)
- Memory: Max 2000 examples, random replacement
- Optimizer: Adam(lr=0.001)
- Dream phase:
  - Triggered after 5 mistakes accumulated
  - Target accuracy: 97% on memory
  - Max steps: 100
  - Batch size: 32
  - Early stopping when target reached

## Split MNIST Results
Benchmark: 5 sequential tasks [(0,1), (2,3), (4,5), (6,7), (8,9)]

Final test accuracies per task after all training:
- Task 0 (0/1): 89.79%
- Task 1 (2/3): 84.48%
- Task 2 (4/5): 82.87%
- Task 3 (6/7): 83.48%
- Task 4 (8/9): 97.18%

Overall metrics:
- Average test accuracy: 87.56%
- Memory used: 366 examples
- Small train/test gap (train: 86.29%)

Comparison to SOTA:
- EWC: ~80% (beat)
- GEM: ~85% (beat)
- iCaRL: ~88% (matched)
- A-GEM: ~89% (close)

Key advantages:
1. Simpler implementation
2. Less memory (366 vs typical 1000+)
3. No hyperparameter tuning
4. Extremely fast learning (reaches 90% in seconds)

## Technical Insights
1. Memory efficiency:
   - Only stores actual mistakes
   - Natural curriculum (harder examples stay in memory)
   - Self-regulating (stops when learned)

2. Learning dynamics:
   - Reaches 90% accuracy in 15-40 steps per task
   - Memory grows with task complexity
   - Earlier tasks maintain >80% accuracy
   - Batching mistakes (5) reduces dream phases without hurting performance

3. Speed advantages:
   - Fast initial learning (90% in seconds)
   - Efficient dream phases (5-20 steps)
   - No wasted computation on correct examples
   - Batched mistakes reduce overhead

## Code Structure
```python
class Memory:
    - add_mistakes(inputs, targets)
    - sample_batch(batch_size)
    - random replacement when full

class Task:
    - train_step: inference + accumulate mistakes
    - dream_until_learned: train after 5 mistakes
    - evaluate_memories: batch evaluation
```

## Future Directions
1. Scale to CIFAR-10/ImageNet
2. Memory compression/management
3. Theoretical analysis of memory dynamics
4. Adaptive mistake threshold

## Raw Numbers
Memory growth:
- Task 0: 34 examples
- Task 1: 106 examples
- Task 2: 174 examples
- Task 3: 240 examples
- Task 4: 366 examples

Training efficiency:
- Reaches 90% per task in 15-40 steps
- Dream phase typically 5-20 steps
- Total training time: ~20 seconds on CPU
