# Learning from Mistakes: A Simple Approach to Continual Learning

Ever notice how humans learn? We don't constantly review everything we know. Instead, we focus on our mistakes. When we mess up, we remember it, and we practice until we get it right. What if we could make neural networks learn the same way?

## The Problem: Catastrophic Forgetting

Neural networks have a frustrating problem: they're great at learning new things, but they tend to completely forget what they learned before. Imagine teaching a network to recognize cats and dogs, then teaching it about birds. By the time it's good at spotting birds, it's forgotten everything about cats and dogs!

This is called "catastrophic forgetting", and it's a major challenge in machine learning. The current solutions are pretty complex - they involve things like elastic weight consolidation, gradient episodic memory, and other techniques that sound like they came from a sci-fi novel.

But what if we could solve this more naturally?

## A Simple Idea: Remember Your Mistakes

Here's our approach:
1. When the model sees a new example, it just tries to answer (no training)
2. If it gets it wrong, we store that example in memory
3. Every so often, we make the model practice the examples it got wrong until it masters them
4. Repeat!

It's like a student who:
- Takes a test without studying (inference)
- Marks down which questions they got wrong (memory)
- Studies those specific questions until they understand them (dream phase)
- Moves on to new material while occasionally reviewing past mistakes

## Does It Actually Work?

We tested this on the standard Split MNIST benchmark - teaching a network to recognize digits (0-9) one pair at a time. The usual problem is that by the time the network learns 8s and 9s, it's completely forgotten what 0s and 1s look like.

The results were surprising:
- Regular training: Complete forgetting (0% on old tasks)
- Our method: Maintains >80% accuracy on everything!
- Uses less memory than other methods
- Trains faster (30 seconds on a CPU!)

Here's what the memory looks like as we learn:
- First pair (0,1): 39 examples
- Second pair (2,3): 125 examples
- Third pair (4,5): 202 examples
- Fourth pair (6,7): 283 examples
- Final pair (8,9): 430 examples

The memory grows naturally with the difficulty of the tasks. And the total memory (430 examples) is way less than the 1000+ examples that other methods typically need.

## Why Does It Work?

The magic seems to be in how it creates a natural curriculum:
1. Easy examples get learned quickly and drop out of memory
2. Hard examples stay in memory and get more practice
3. The model only trains on actual mistakes, not examples it already knows
4. There's no wasted effort on easy examples

It's also self-regulating:
- If the model is doing well, it practices less
- If it's struggling, it practices more
- If it starts forgetting old tasks, those examples come back into memory

## The Code is Simple Too!

The core logic is just two classes:
```python
class Memory:
    def add_mistakes(self, inputs, targets):
        # Store examples the model got wrong
        
    def sample_batch(self, batch_size):
        # Get a random batch to practice

class Task:
    def train_step(self, inputs, targets):
        # Try to solve without training
        # If mistakes, add to memory and practice
        
    def dream_until_learned(self):
        # Practice memory until 97% accurate
```

No complex loss functions, no careful hyperparameter tuning, just remembering and practicing mistakes.

## What's Next?

We're excited to try this on harder problems:
1. More complex datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet)
2. Smarter memory management (maybe use RL?)
3. Understanding why it works so well
4. Finding its limitations

The code is available at [link], and we'd love to see what others do with this idea!

## Technical Details

For those interested in the nitty-gritty:
- Network: Simple CNN (2 conv layers, 3 FC layers)
- Memory: Max 2000 examples, random replacement
- Optimizer: Adam(lr=0.001)
- Dream phase target: 97% accuracy on memory
- Evaluation: Split MNIST benchmark (5 sequential tasks)
- Final test accuracy: 88.19% (matches state-of-the-art)

But the real beauty is that you don't need to understand any of that to get the core idea: just remember your mistakes and practice them until you get them right!
